title: Capture the Flag!
---

---
## What is Capture the Flag?
---
In the field of Computer Security, a Capture the flag (CTF) is usually a game which involves solving a series of puzzles or challenges to find a hidden piece of text called a 'flag'. You'll see a lot more of these if you take the course on Computer and Network Security - CSCD27!


---
## The Game
---
Your mission - if you choose to accept it - will be to follow the series of clues starting at this webpage till you find the hidden flag. The flag will consist of some text within curly braces, which will look something like this:

```
{FLAG-HERE}
```

Some of these challenges will not be easy - you will have to use the material you have learned in this course so far. You have already seen (in some part) all of the methods that can be used to solve the challenges. The clues will be hidden, so keep an eye out! No further hints will be given! Don't ask for help on Piazza, these are meant to be solved yourself. No further hints will be given.

## The Prize

The first person to successfully find the flag and make a response to the Piazza post will be declared the winner.
