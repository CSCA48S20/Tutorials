No tutorial in the first week of class! However, make sure you've done the following:

 - Set up your compiler, added it to your PATH

 - Looked at and attempted exercise 1.

 - Got yourself a good code editor (I highly recommend [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)). Try to avoid using
    IDEs since you're going to have to get used to the command line eventually - better now than later!

 - Read the notes and attempted the exercises in them. Learning C can be difficult for the first time, and the only
    way to get good at it is to practice. You have tons of help available, make sure you use it!
